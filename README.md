##INITIAL README (deprecated).
0. We have not yet decided on a name for our app. Likely, it will be a soup or ramen based pun. I'm sorry, but also sorry that I'm not sorry.
1. **A short description of your project:**
  1. _What will our app do?_ 
    * It will be a no-frills, simple to use, very visually pleasing "To-do List" web app. Something along the lines of what "Google Keep" is to "Evernote"; similar functionality, yet intentionally stripped down.
  2. _Who will use it?_ 
    * Us! Our entire group agrees that we would like to create something that we will actually use and find useful! Personally, I've found apps like Anydo and Wunderlist to be overbearing in visual flair and features. I'd love a trimmed down alternative.
  3. _What are its main features?_
    * The app will store "to-do" items in a simple, visually pleasing manner.
    * The app will have the ability to designate different levels of priority (based on color / color-coded) and assign those priorities to different tasks.
    * The app will provide the occasional gentle reminder to the user to not ignore tasks designated as low-priority.
    * Fade-in animations!
    * If possible, the app will store user credentials on Firebase. If that proves to be too much, it will utilize localStorage.
    * Maybe a changeable color scheme? 
2. **A list of libraries, frameworks and APIs your app will use**
  1. HTML/Javascript (obligatory)
  2. React/ReactDOM/React add-ons/JSX/Babel-standalone*. 
  3. Bootstrap or MDL.
  4. React Animations.
